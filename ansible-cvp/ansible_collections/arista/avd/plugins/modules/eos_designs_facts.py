module: eos_designs_facts
version_added: "3.5.0"
author: Arista Ansible Team (@aristanetworks)
short_description: Set eos_designs facts
description:
  - The `arista.avd.eos_designs_facts` module is an Ansible Action Plugin providing the following capabilities
  - Set `avd_switch_facts` fact containing both `switch` facts per host.
  - Set `avd_topology_peers` fact containing list of downlink switches per host.
    This list is built based on the `uplink_switches` from all other hosts.
  - Set `avd_overlay_peers` fact containing list of EVPN or MPLS overlay peers per host.
    This list is built based on the `evpn_route_servers` and `mpls_route_reflectors` from all other hosts.
  - The plugin is designed to `run_once`. With this, Ansible will set the same facts on all devices,
    so all devices can lookup values of any other device without using the slower `hostvars`.
  - The facts can also be copied to the "root" `switch` in a task run per-device (see example below)
  - The module is used in `arista.avd.eos_designs` to set facts for devices, which are then used by jinja templates
    in `arista.avd.eos_designs` to generate the `structured_configuration`.
