module: validate_and_template
version_added: "3.8.0"
author: Arista Ansible Team (@aristanetworks)
short_description: Validate input data according to Schema, render Jinja2 template and write result to a file.
description:
  - The `arista.avd.validate_and_template` Action Plugin performs data conversions and validation according to the supplied Schema.
  - The converted data is then used to render a Jinja2 template and writing the result to a file.
  - The Action Plugin supports different modes for conversion and validation, to either block the playbook or just warn the user if
  - the input data is not valid.
  - For Markdown files the plugin can also run md_toc on the output before writing to the file.
