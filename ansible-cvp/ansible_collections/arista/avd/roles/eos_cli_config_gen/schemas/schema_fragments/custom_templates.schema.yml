      - Custom templates can be added below the playbook directory.
      - If a location above the directory is desired, a symbolic link can be used.
      - Example under the `playbooks` directory create symbolic link with the following command:

        ```bash
        ln -s ../../shared_repo/custom_avd_templates/ ./custom_avd_templates
