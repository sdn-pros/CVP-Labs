# BETA Feature

The MPLS design feature is in BETA until the release of AVD 4.0.0. Changes to data models and default behavior for the MPLS design should be expected.

## Connected Endpoints for MPLS design

- The MPLS design supports all connected endpoint variables already supported by l3ls-evpn barring the exceptions outlined in this document.
- The connected endpoints variables, define endpoints that connect to the fabric on pe interface(s).
- The connected endpoints are leveraged to define any device that connects to a pe switch ports, i.e.: routers, cpes.
- Connected endpoints key/value pairs are designed to be extended for your own needs and leveraged to configure the endpoint itself.

## Connected Endpoints Keys

```yaml
# Example
# The below key/pair values are the role defaults for the mpls design type.
connected_endpoints_keys:
  routers:
    type: router
  cpes:
    type: cpe
```

## Unsupported variables

Some of the default connected endpoint keys for the `l3ls-evpn` design are not supported by default with the `mpls` design:

```yaml
servers:
  <server>:
firewalls:
  <firewall>:
load_balancers:
  <load balancer>:
storage_arrays:
  <storage array>:
```

MLAG is not supported with MPLS-EVPN topologies, therefore it is necessary to use the EVPN A/A data model if a dual-homed port-channel configuration is desired. As such, the following data model will not render a functional configuration:

```yaml
cpes:
  cpe01:
    rack: RackB
    adapters:
      - endpoint_ports: [ E0, E1 ]
        switch_ports: [ Ethernet10, Ethernet10 ]
        switches: [ DC1-SVC3A, DC1-SVC3B ]
        profile: VM_Servers
        port_channel:
          description: PortChanne1
          mode: active
```

The short_esi variable is mandatory in order to have a functional multihomed port-channel:

```yaml
cpes:
  cpe01:
    rack: RackB
    adapters:
      - endpoint_ports: [ E0, E1 ]
        switch_ports: [ Ethernet10, Ethernet10 ]
        switches: [ DC1-SVC3A, DC1-SVC4A ]
        profile: VM_Servers
        port_channel:
          description: PortChanne1
          mode: active
          short_esi: 0303:0202:0101
```
