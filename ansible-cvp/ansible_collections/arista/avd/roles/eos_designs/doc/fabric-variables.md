# Fabric Variables

- The fabric underlay and overlay topology variables, define the elements related to build the L3 Leaf and Spine fabric.
- The following underlay routing protocols are supported:
  - EBGP (default for l3ls-evpn)
  - OSPF.
  - ISIS.
  - ISIS-SR*.
  - ISIS-LDP*.
  - ISIS-SR-LDP*.
  - OSPF-LDP*.
  - none**.
- The following overlay routing protocols are supported:
  - EBGP (default for l3ls-evpn)
  - IBGP (only with OSPF or ISIS variants in underlay)
  - none**
  - HER (Head-End Replication)***
- Only summary network addresses need to be defined. IP addresses are then assigned to each node, based on its unique device id.
  - To view IP address allocation and consumption, a summary is provided in the auto-generated fabric documentation in Markdown and CSV format.

*) Only supported with core_interfaces data model.

**) For use with design type "l2ls" or other designs where there is no requirement for a routing protocol for underlay and/or overlay on l3 devices.

***) By setting `overlay_routing_protocol:HER`, `eos_designs` will configure static VXLAN flood-lists instead of using a dynamic overlay protocol.

## Flagging a Device as Not Deployed

- It is possible to provision configurations for a complete topology but flag devices as undeployed using the host level variable `is_deployed: false`.

  ```yaml
  # Use at the host level
  is_deployed: < true | false | default -> true >
  ```

- By default, this will have no impact within the `eos_designs` role. Configs will still be generated by the `eos_cli_config_gen` role and will still be pushed by the `eos_config_deploy_eapi` directly to devices if used.
- However, if the `eos_config_deploy_cvp` role is used to push configurations, CloudVision will ignore the devices flagged  as `is_deployed: false` and not attempt to configure them.
- If the device is not present in the network due to CloudVision not configuring the device, `eos_validate_state` role will fail lldp_toplogy and interface tests on peers of the undeployed device trying to verify that interfaces are up.
- To overcome this and shutdown interfaces towards undeployed peers, the variable `shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers` can be used, satisfying the `eos_validate_state` role interface and lldp_topology tests. Again, this is only an issue if `eos_config_deploy_cvp` is used and the devices are not present in the network.

#   You can tune the settings by overridding the default variable: "platform_settings[platforms].trident_forwarding_table_partition:"

```

## Details on `enable_trunk_groups`

Enabling the use of trunk groups will change the behavior of several components in AVD.

Changes:

- **Requires** Trunk Groups to be defined on all trunks towards connected endpoints
- `MLAG` Trunk Group will be configured on all vlans on MLAG switches
- Use Trunk Groups for uplinks to L2 switches instead of "switchport trunk allow vlan" lists.
  - On the parent switch a Trunk Group with the name of the L2 switch will be assigned on all vlans
    that are allowed towards the L2 switch.
  - The port-channel towards the L2 switch will be assigned to this trunk group only
  - Add `UPLINK` Trunk Group to all vlans on the L2 Switch and assign this to the uplink port-channel

![Figure: Enable Trunk Groups](../../../media/enable_trunk_groups.png)

While it is recommended for consistency to set `enable_trunk_groups` for all devices in the fabric,
it can also be set in group_vars or host_vars since trunk-groups are only local to a switch.

!!! warning
    Because of the nature of the EOS Trunk Group feature, enabling this is "all or nothing".
    *All* vlans and *all* trunks towards connected endpoints must be using trunk groups as well.
    If trunk groups are not assigned to a trunk, no vlans will be enabled on that trunk.

## Details on `only_local_vlan_trunk_groups`

Enabling this feature will prevent unneeded trunk groups from being configured on vlans.

Using the figure under [Details on `enable_trunk_groups`](#details-on-enable_trunk_groups) as basis
enabling with feature would remove the unmatched trunk groups like this:
