# Connected Endpoints

AVD supports two different data models for defining connectivity to endpoints:

- "Connected Endpoints" is an endpoint-centric model intended for servers or other use cases where most ports have unique configurations.
- "Network Ports" is a compact and port-centric model intended for configuration of generic port configurations on large ranges of ports.

Both data models share the same underlying implementation and can coexist without conflicts, as long as the same switchports are not
defined in both models.

Both data models support variable inheritance from profiles defined under [`port_profiles`](#port-profiles). The profiles can be shared between the models. Any setting defined under the `port_profiles` will be inherited from `parent_profile` to `profile` to `adapter`.

## Connected Endpoints

- The connected endpoints variables define connectivity from the perspective of the endpoints that connect to the fabric.
- Each endpoint can have one or more `adapters` defined, under which the connected `switches`, `switch_ports` and `endpoint_ports`
  must be set.
- If port_channel mode is enabled under one "adapter", all switch_ports connected to that "adapter" will become part of this port-channel.
- The keys used to define `connected_endpoints` are configurable using [`connected_endpoints_keys`](#connected-endpoints-keys).
  The default keys are: `servers`, `firewalls`, `routers`, `load_balancers` and `storage_arrays`.

## Network Ports

- `network_ports` is intended to be used with `port_profiles` and `parent_profiles` to keep the configuration generic and compact, but all
  features and keys supported under `connected_endpoints.adapters` is also supported directly under `network_ports`.
- Since all ranges defined under `network_ports` will be expanded to individual port configurations, it is not possible to configure a
  port-channel with multiple interfaces on the same device. For this special case `connected_endpoints` should be used.

### Network Ports

The `network_ports` data model is intended to be used with `port_profiles` and `parent_profiles` to keep the configuration generic and compact,
but all features and keys supported under `connected_endpoints.adapters` is also supported directly under `network_ports`.

Since all ranges defined under `network_ports` will be expanded to individual port configurations, it is not possible to configure a
port-channel with multiple interfaces on the same device. For this special case `connected_endpoints` should be used.

The expansiont to individual port configurations also lead to inconsistent configurations when used with `short_esi: auto` or
`designated_forwarder_algorithm: auto`, since those rely on information from multiple switches and interfaces.

```yaml
# Network Ports | Optional
# All switch_ports ranges are expanded into individual port configurations.
# Switches are matched with regular expressions, which must match the full hostname.
network_ports:
  - switches:
      - < regex matching the full hostname of one or more switches >
    # Switch_ports is a list of ranges using AVD range_expand syntax (see link below).
    # Ex Ethernet1-48 or Ethernet2-3/1-48
    switch_ports:
      - < interface | interface_range >
    description: < description to be used on all ports >

    # Port-profile name, to inherit configuration.
    profile: < port_profile_name >

    < any keys supported under connected_endpoints adapters >
```

For more details and examples of the `range_expand` syntax, see the [arista.avd.range_expand documentation](../../../plugins/README.md#range_expand-filter)

### Port Profiles

```yaml
# Optional profiles to share common settings for connected_endpoints and/or network_ports
# Keys are the same used under endpoints adapters. Keys defined under endpoints adapters take precedence.
port_profiles:
  < port_profile_name >:
    # Parent Profile | Optional
    # Port_profiles can refer to another port_profile to inherit settings in up to two levels (adapter->profile->parent_profile).
    parent_profile: < port_profile_name >

    < any keys supported under connected_endpoints adapters >
```

### Connected Endpoints Keys

```yaml
# Define connected endpoints keys, to define grouping of endpoints connecting to the fabric.
# This provides the ability to define various keys of your choice to better organize/group your data.
# This should be defined in top level group_var for the fabric.
# The default values will be overridden if defining this key, so it is recommended to copy the defaults and modify them.
connected_endpoints_keys:
  < key_1 >:
    type: < type used for documentation >
  < key_2 >:
    type: < type used for documentation >
```

```yaml
# Example
# The below key/pair values are the role defaults.
connected_endpoints_keys:
  servers:
    type: server
  firewalls:

### EVPN A/A ESI dual-attached endpoint examples

To help provide consistency when configuring EVPN A/A ESI values, arista.avd provides an abstraction in the form of a `short_esi` key.
`short_esi` is an abbreviated 3 octets value to encode [Ethernet Segment ID](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432#section-8.3.1) and LACP ID.
Transformation from abstraction to network values is managed by a [filter_plugin](../../../plugins/README.md) and provides following result:

- *EVPN ESI*: 000:000:0303:0202:0101
- *LACP ID*: 0303.0202.0101
- *Route Target*: 03:03:02:02:01:01

In addition, setting the `short_esi` key to `auto` generates the short_esi automatically using a hash of the following data elements:

- Port-Channel Interfaces: first two uplink switch hostnames, the ports on those switches, the corresponding endpoint ports and the channel-group ID.
- Port-Channel Subinterface: first two uplink switch hostname, the ports on those switches, the corresponding endpoint ports, the channel-group ID and the subinterface number.
- Ethernet Interfaces: first two uplink switch hostnames, the ports on those switches, the corresponding endpoint ports and the interface number.

It should be noted that arista.avd does not currently check for hash collisions when using `short_esi: auto` and while the risk of this happening is non-zero, it is small.

Active/Active multihoming connections:

- From `E0` to `DC1-SVC3A` interface `Eth10`
- From `E1` to `DC1-SVC4A` interface `Eth10`
