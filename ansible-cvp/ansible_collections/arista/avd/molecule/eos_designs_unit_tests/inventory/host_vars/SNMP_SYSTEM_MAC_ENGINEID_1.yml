# Minimum config to only test the specific feature.
# This tests the SNMP engineID using system MAC
# As well as the fact that default_engineid_from_system_mac has precedence over compute_local_engineid
# Setting system_mac_address as a topology variable and host variable, topology
# should have precedence
